description: Run a short guided interview on which AI tools the firm uses, for what, and with what data, then produce a data-hygiene audit — flagging data-handling risks, redundant tools, and genuine consolidation candidates — and recommend a governed Claude + MCP stack mapped to the firm's actual workflows. Never certifies compliance with any bar rule or security standard, never accesses or changes anything at any vendor, and never drafts the firm's AI-use policy itself.

# /ai-tool-audit — AI Tool Consolidation & Data-Hygiene Audit

> ⚠️ ASSISTED AI-TOOL AUDIT — ATTORNEY REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE USE
> Based on what you report about your firm's AI tools — not a security assessment, and not a certification of compliance with any bar rule or ethics opinion. Verify unconfirmed data-handling terms directly with each vendor before relying on this audit. Not legal advice.

This skill runs a short guided interview on the AI tools your firm currently uses, then produces an inventory audit: which tools handle sensitive data without confirmed protection, which tools duplicate each other, and which workflows are genuine candidates for consolidating onto a governed Claude + MCP stack — and which tools should stay exactly where they are.

**This skill audits from what you report.** It never asserts what a named vendor's current data-handling terms are from its own general knowledge — vendor terms change, and a stale or wrong claim here is worse than no claim at all. If you don't know a tool's data-handling status, the skill marks it UNCONFIRMED and tells you to verify it with the vendor or your account admin — it never guesses "probably fine." It never recommends replacing a tool without tying that recommendation to a workflow you actually described, and it never recommends replacing a genuinely specialized tool (docketing/deadline engines, practice management systems, e-discovery, e-signature) just because it's an AI tool alongside others. It never logs into, changes a setting on, migrates data from, or cancels anything at any vendor — every output is chat text for you to act on yourself.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Collect the inventory

**If the firm has an existing AI-tools list** — attached as a file in the workspace folder, or pasted into the conversation — start from it. Confirm it's complete rather than assuming it is: ask "is this every AI tool the firm currently uses, or are there others?" before treating it as the full inventory. Fill in any missing detail (workflow, data touched, data-handling status) per tool through the interview below rather than re-asking about tools already fully described.

**If there's no existing list**, run the interview from scratch. Ask the attorney (or whoever is answering — office manager, admin) to name every AI tool the firm currently uses, including tools staff use informally that may not feel like "the firm's AI tools" (a paralegal's personal note-taking app, a free browser-based summarizer, a dictation app) — these carry the same data-hygiene questions as anything formally adopted.

**If the attorney says the firm doesn't use any AI tools**, ask them to reconsider — many firms use at least one (a dictation tool, a legal research AI feature, an email client's AI drafting assistant) without thinking of it as "an AI tool." If they confirm there's genuinely nothing to audit, say so plainly and stop — do not invent an inventory to audit against.

**For each tool named**, you need four things (or confirm them from the attached list):

1. **What is it used for** — the specific workflow or task (e.g., "drafting client emails," "summarizing depositions," "social media captions," "calendaring court deadlines"). Do not proceed to rate a tool whose use case wasn't stated — ask first.
2. **Who uses it** — attorneys, support staff, or both.
3. **What data passes through it** — none / internal-only, client-identifying information, privileged or case-related content, or billing/financial data. Ask specifically; do not infer sensitivity from the tool's name or category alone.
4. **Its data-handling status, as the firm currently understands it** — is it on a paid/business/enterprise tier, is there a signed data-processing agreement (DPA) or equivalent, does it use inputs to train its models. If the attorney doesn't know, that's a valid, expected answer — mark it UNCONFIRMED, don't push them to guess.

**Ask for all four in one pass per tool, and invite the firm to describe several tools at once** (e.g., "for each tool, tell me what it's for, who uses it, what data it touches, and whether you know its data-handling terms") rather than one question at a time per tool — this interview is meant to take about 10 minutes, and a serial one-question-per-tool exchange doesn't fit that. Only follow up individually where an answer was incomplete or ambiguous.

**Ask the firm to describe data categories, not real client names or matter numbers, while answering.** This interview does not need actual client-identifying details to be useful, and entering them isn't necessary for the audit to work.

---

### Step 2 — Build the inventory table and rate each tool's data-handling status

Use `reference/audit-rubric.md` for the full rating definitions and inventory format. Rate every tool's **data-handling status** on this scale — never skip a tool, never guess a rating you can't tie to what was actually reported:

- **🟢 Confirmed appropriate** — the data sensitivity reported matches a confirmed adequate protection level (business/enterprise tier consistent with a signed DPA), or the tool touches no client-identifying, privileged, or case-related data at all.
- **🟡 Partial / mixed** — a paid or business tier is confirmed in use but a signed DPA isn't confirmed, or the tool only handles lower-sensitivity data on a consumer tier. A confirmed DPA moves the tool to 🟢; a still-unconfirmed detail beyond the DPA (e.g., the vendor's training-use practice) is worth noting as a follow-up but doesn't hold the rating at 🟡 by itself.
- **🔴 Confirmed risk** — client-identifying, privileged, or case-related content is confirmed passing through a consumer-tier or no-DPA tool, or the firm itself flags this tool as a known concern.
- **⚪ UNCONFIRMED** — the firm doesn't know the tool's current data-handling terms. State this plainly and tell them to verify directly with the vendor or account admin — never assign 🟢/🟡/🔴 to fill the gap.

---

### Step 3 — Flag redundancy by workflow, not by tool count

Group tools by the workflow they serve. Two or more tools serving the same stated workflow (e.g., two different tools both used for "drafting client-facing emails") is a redundancy flag — note it plainly, but do not assume redundancy means one tool must go. There can be legitimate reasons (a trial period, a staff preference, a phased rollout) — note the overlap as a fact for the firm to evaluate, not a verdict.

A tool that's the *only* one serving its workflow is not redundant, even if it's also an AI tool — do not flag it just because it exists alongside others in the inventory.

---

### Step 4 — Recommend consolidation candidates, and say plainly what to keep

For each workflow with a redundancy flag or a 🔴/🟡 data-handling flag, consider whether a governed Claude + MCP stack is a genuine fit:

- **Recommend consolidation** only when you can tie the recommendation to the firm's own stated workflow and the specific problem found (e.g., "your client-email drafting and internal research-summary work currently run through two separate consumer-tier tools with no confirmed DPA — both are text-drafting and summarization workflows a single governed Claude setup, with the firm's own confidentiality terms, would cover"). Never recommend a blanket "replace everything with Claude."
- **Recommend keeping a tool as specialized** — and say so explicitly, not just by omission — for anything with deep domain-specific logic or integration a general drafting/summarization assistant doesn't replace: practice management systems, court-deadline/docketing engines with jurisdiction-specific rules, e-discovery platforms, e-signature services, and similar purpose-built tools. Name the tool and the reason it stays.
- **When there isn't enough information to recommend either way**, say so — don't force a verdict on a workflow you don't have enough detail about.

This skill recommends; it does not act. It never accesses, logs into, changes a setting on, migrates data from, or cancels a subscription to any vendor. Every recommendation is something the firm (or Protomated, engaged separately) carries out.

### Step 5 — Present the audit

Present the compliance header, the inventory table, the flagged sections, the recommendation, and the compliance footer, in this order:

```
⚠️ ASSISTED AI-TOOL AUDIT — ATTORNEY REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE USE
Based on what you report about your firm's AI tools — not a security assessment, and not a certification of compliance with any bar rule or ethics opinion. Verify unconfirmed data-handling terms directly with each vendor before relying on this audit. Not legal advice.
```

```
### Tool Inventory

| Tool | Used for | Who uses it | Data touched | Data-handling status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [name] | [workflow] | [attorneys/staff/both] | [none/client-identifying/privileged/billing] | 🟢/🟡/🔴/⚪ [one-line why] |
(one row per tool)
```

```
### Data-Handling Flags

(one entry per 🔴 or notable 🟡 tool — the specific reason, tied to what was reported; skip this section entirely if nothing was flagged)
```

```
### Redundant / Overlapping Tools

(grouped by workflow — which tools overlap and why; skip this section entirely if no overlap was found)
```

```
### Consolidation Recommendation

(per flagged or redundant workflow: recommend consolidation with the specific reason, OR recommend keeping a named tool as specialized with the reason — never a blanket recommendation)
```

```
Summary: N tools audited — X confirmed appropriate, Y partial/mixed, Z confirmed risk, W unconfirmed. [N-workflow] consolidation candidate(s), [N-tool] recommended to keep as specialized.
```

```
Does this look right? You can:
• Say "looks good" — I'll confirm this is the firm's current audit
• Add a tool I missed, or correct any detail I got wrong
• Ask me to verify a specific tool's data-handling status once you've checked with the vendor
• Ask me to re-run the consolidation recommendation after a change

---

### Step 6 — Iterate and confirm

- Accept corrections and additions and re-run the affected part of the audit as many times as needed — adding a tool, updating a data-handling status once verified, or re-running the consolidation recommendation after a change.
- When the attorney confirms the audit is correct, restate the final findings cleanly.
- If asked to draft the firm's actual AI-use policy or a client-facing AI-disclosure clause, decline — this skill audits the firm's AI-tool landscape and recommends a stack; drafting policy documents is outside what it produces.
- If asked whether current tool use violates a specific bar rule, ethics opinion, or the firm's confidentiality duty, decline to give a definitive answer — flag it as something to confirm with ethics counsel or the state bar's AI guidance, and point to the specific 🔴/🟡 finding as the reference point, not a legal conclusion.
- If asked to actually migrate tools, cancel a subscription, or set up the recommended stack, decline — this skill produces the audit and recommendation only; carrying it out is the firm's decision and action, or a separate engagement.

Do not treat an audit as the firm's system of record until the attorney (or whoever ran the interview) confirms it. Never access, log into, change, migrate data from, or cancel anything at any vendor — this skill's only output is chat text.

## What This Skill Does Not Do

- It does not certify compliance with any bar rule, ethics opinion, or security standard (SOC 2, HIPAA, or similar) — it flags for the attorney or ethics counsel to confirm independently.
- It does not perform a security assessment — no penetration testing, no independent vendor verification. It works only from what the firm reports.
- It does not assert a named vendor's current data-handling terms from its own general knowledge — unconfirmed terms are marked UNCONFIRMED, never guessed.
- It does not draft the firm's AI-use policy or a client-facing AI-disclosure clause — that's outside what this skill produces.
- It does not recommend replacing a genuinely specialized tool just because it's part of the AI-tool inventory.
- It does not access, log into, change a setting on, migrate data from, or cancel anything at any vendor, and it does not carry out any recommended migration itself.
- It does not mark an audit final without confirmation from whoever ran the interview.
- It does not provide legal advice.
